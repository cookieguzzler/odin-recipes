    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ lb uncooked store-bought organic pizza dough</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Topping:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ sweet red pepper, cored, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 shallot, halved</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>½ oz fresh parsley leaves with some stem</li>
        <li>7 oz ground lamb or ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground allspice</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ tsp Aleppo-style pepper</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Private Reserve Greek extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges for later</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Adjust oven rack to the middle. (or see stove-top instructions in notes)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Prepare the meat mixture. In the large bowl of a food processor, fitted with blade, add red peppers, shallot, garlic, and parsley. Pulse a few times to chop. To the mixture, add ground lamb (or beef). Season with spices and salt. Add tomato paste and extra virgin olive oil. Now pulse again until well-combined (about 8 to 10 pulses.)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Prepare two large rimmed baking sheets lined with parchment paper (you'll be using these to bake the Lahmacun in batches.)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Divide the pizza dough into 4 equal balls (about 2 oz each.) Working with one ball of dough at a time, place on a floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll dough out into as thin as you can to a disk that's about 8 or 9 inches in diameter.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Assemble Lahmacun. Place one flatbread disk on one of the prepared pans. Reshape as needed.  Spoon 3–4 tablespoon topping onto dough and spread topping evenly to edges, leaving a thin boarder.</li>
        <li>Bake in heated oven for about 5 to 7 minutes or until dough and meat are fully cooked (dough will be a little crusty around the edges.)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Repeat steps 5 and 6 with the remaining dough.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Squeeze a little lemon juice on top. Serve Lahmacun hot or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
